# See Plus Plus (C++ samples)

* Just starting out with a console app and a static library.
* Looking for a command line parser...  (might have to create my own)
* Forgot to add a .gitignore so I grabbed it from another VS project so the WHOLE WORLD isn't added.

## History

It's been about 18 years since I **really** coded in C++.  There has been some instances where I've had to read (wade through)
somebody's C++ code and that's not too bad.  But from working with .Net for quite some time, you have to remember how to deal with
memory management and I'm sure there are other features that have been added since 2002.

This project started out as just getting a few things built and pieces some classes together.  Ideally this will be an "sounding board"
or proof of concept for block chain based software installations.
